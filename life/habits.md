# Habits

I use [Habit](https://apps.apple.com/ru/story/id1457978859) iOS app to track my life habits. I realized that I often forget to do daily routine things (back exercises, workouts) and move forward to my current goals (English learning, golang practice etc) This application helps me. I try to fill every day with all habits except for the weekend. At the weekend I rest and can make only some activities.
